# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 6, 2019 
##### The Very First Code

**Today's Progress**: reviewed basic python variable types, list, built-in functions, methods for object types, brief start on numpy package. Next is on matplotlib, dictionaries, tabular dataset, logics, and conditional statement. If I have enough time, I may be doing pandas as well.

**Thoughts:** Going over took quite some time, and difference in index in R and python still confuses me alot. At this point, I need to try it before understanding which starts at 0 and 1.

### Day 2: September 7, 2019 
##### Second Code

**Today's Progress**: Matplotlib using data from Kaggle. 

**Thoughts:** Wow. Honestly I was planning on covering matplotlib, dictionaries, tabular dataset, logics, and conditional statement, and maybe pandas. But it took me a while to remember how to subset dataframe with pandas, so I had to review that again before demonstrating how matplotlib works. Less progress made, but at least I got a hand on decent sized dataset from kaggle. Tomorrow, I should be able to finish dictionaries, tabular dataset, logics, and conditional statement.
