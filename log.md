# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 6, 2019 
##### The Very First Code

**Today's Progress**: reviewed basic python variable types, list, built-in functions, methods for object types, brief start on numpy package. Next is on matplotlib, dictionaries, tabular dataset, logics, and conditional statement. If I have enough time, I may be doing pandas as well.

**Thoughts:** Going over took quite some time, and difference in index in R and python still confuses me alot. At this point, I need to try it before understanding which starts at 0 and 1.
